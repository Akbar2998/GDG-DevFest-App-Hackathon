## What is DevFest?
DevFests are community-led developer events hosted by Google Developer Groups around the globe. GDGs are focused on community building and learning about Google’s technologies. 

DevFests may cover multiple products such as Android, Firebase, Google Cloud Platform, Google Assistant, Flutter, machine learning with TensorFlow, and mobile web. Events may include speaker sessions, hackathons, codelabs, study jams, and trainings with speakers from Google, Google Developers Experts, Women Techmaker Ambassadors and speakers from other companies.

Be a part of a unique community moment in 2020, and join the fully virtual DevFest movement happening over one epic weekend where communities from across the globe will come together to connect, learn, and most importantly, have fun! 

The winner application might be used as an official application for GDG DevFest Tashkent/Central Asia 2020.
